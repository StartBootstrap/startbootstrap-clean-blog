          <p>Employment is such a tough topic to speak about openly at this point in life. Most of my peers are hoping to land the “dream job” and there’s nothing wrong with this except that most of us are trying to land that same dream as well. I am going through the recruiting process this week and actually had my first technical interview today. I think that the whole idea of coding on a whiteboard or a screen being physically seen while I code or otherwise being analyzed if not physically present is intimidating. I think that from my point of view, since my sophomore year rolled around, I found the whole institution of technical recruiting basically impossible. I kept telling myself I already got “this far” by being at Notre Dame and that I shouldn’t push on joining this industry that I know is the elite of the elite because you have to be incredibly smart to enter. On other occasions I just told myself that I could find a job somewhere else, that I didn’t HAVE to have my DREAM job because it was so unattainable. Here’s where the article on why women don’t negotiate their job offers really resonated with me. I think most of us women just don’t want to “push our luck” with what we have achieved. I now know this is wrong. I am busting by butt to read and train with LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview (written by a woman, by the way), to make sure I am not closing the doors of opportunity myself without even knocking on them. When reading about attempting to negotiate your pay I literally thought to myself, “I consider myself luck to even have a job, what is this demanding more money stuff!”. I think that I never even considered it because my mind just didn’t dream of these opportunities before I came to Notre Dame. </p>

          <p>When I was in High School, my ultimate goal was Notre Dame. For others, this seemed unattainable or simply unrealistic. For me, I thought, if I made up my mind that this was my dream I was going to pursue it and take the necessary steps to make sure that I present myself like the person I can be, because if they reject me from Notre Dame, it has to be because there was someone better than me, not because I was not good enough. Sure enough, that mindset got me into Notre Dame. Coming from a humble background, I think I failed in the sense that I didn’t set up a new goal or mindset when I arrived here the way I had set Notre Dame as my goal when I got to High School. I thought- “WOW. It is so amazing to have the opportunity to learn here!” that I didn’t consider going beyond. A lot of it was because I was intimidated by the recruiting process- of course.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">My family dropping me off at my DREAM SCHOOL</span>

          <p>Nevertheless, there’s so much more. So much more to thinking about your future beyond Notre Dame. So much more about negotiating salaries, considering non-competes and nondisclosures, so much I didn’t think to think of really. The article that talked about Keith Bollinger’s story (the non compete article) really moved me because I could identify with 18 year-old Keith eager to sign a paper that meant he would be able to provide for himself on his own that he didn’t even consider what a non-compete even meant! I am aware now that the recruiting process from tech companies is much a work-in-progress and a let’s-see-how-you-do ordeal than a step by step guide or a perfect formula on how to hire the best of the best. The companies are learning and eager to hire people like you and me, but they also need to be able to consider all types of applicants.</p>

          <p>I regret not applying to tech companies my sophomore year because I was afraid. I think Notre Dame can and should demystify the recruiting process for technical interviews and push sophomores to go on the deep end, jump off the cliff or whatever and apply. Just try.
	        Today’s interview didn’t go as HORRIBLY as I had anticipated. I survived. No, I even thrived at some points. I realized what killed me were my nerves. That cannot happen. This department should have a program (run by the department) to help freshmen and sophomores through the fear of applying to tech interviews. It would have saved me all the time I lost thinking I wasn’t even close to being good enough when everything I needed to succeed in these interviews was to review Data Structures and PRACTICE. That’s all. And I really wish I knew sooner. </p>
